1. generate a random number between 1-6;
2. roll numbers can add up
3. if the roll number is 1, turn turn total set to 0, game total remains the same. (think about "pass")
4. hold will add turn total to game total and pass
5. if game total reaches 100, that current player wins and game ends.
6. GAME OVER!!!!!!
